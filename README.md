# CommunityHealthService
A database application to monitor the local outbreak of Covid-19. The purpose of this website is to contain all the health services available in the locality and to maintain 
records of the coronavirus cases reported dailly. Among some of the useful features are: display of **availability status** of a doctor, filters to query nearby hospitals sorted by the number of covid-19/dengue/general beds free at the moment and **pandemic analytics**. With the help of Javascript plotting libraries from **HighCharts.com** I have created 
dynamic pages to plot the zonal ,age-wise and time-wise distribution of the covid-19 infection intended for further **statistical analysis**.
