# CommunityHealthService
A database application to monitor the local outbreak of Covid-19. The purpose of this website is to integrate all the information related to healthcare services available in the locality and to maintain 
records of the coronavirus cases reported daily. Among some of the useful features are: 
* Display of **availability status** of a health personnel
* Filters to query nearby hospitals sorted by the number of covid-19/dengue/general beds free at the moment 
* Pandemic analytics. 

With the help of Javascript plotting libraries from **HighCharts.com** I have created dynamic pages to plot the zonal ,age-wise and time-wise distribution of the 
covid-19 infection intended for further **statistical analysis**. The database used is MySQL. Less emphasis has been given to the frontend which will hopefully be
updated soon.

Have a look at the demo!!
